  From Astro to Angular: Why I Rebuilt My Portfolio
</h1>

<p class="mb-4">
  When I first built my portfolio site, I wanted speed, simplicity, and a modern
  tech stack. That’s why I picked Astro. It felt fast, clean, and lightweight.
  For a while, it worked perfectly.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  But as my ambitions for the site grew, I started hitting walls. I didn’t want
  just static pages anymore. I wanted dynamic features, smarter routing, and a
  codebase I could scale without headaches. That’s when I realized Astro wasn’t
  the right fit for me anymore.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  So, I made the switch to Angular. And I don’t regret it for a second.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Astro Was Great at First</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
  Astro is honestly awesome for simple sites. Static generation is lightning
  fast. I loved how I could sprinkle in React or other components without
  shipping tons of JavaScript. My blog and a few static pages loaded almost
  instantly, and that was all I needed in the beginning.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  But as soon as I wanted anything more advanced, things got messy. I started
  gluing together JavaScript for interactivity. Routing felt limited. State
  management required extra libraries. The simplicity that made Astro great also
  became my bottleneck.

  Why I Switched to Angular: 4 Big Wins for My Use Case
</h2>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">
  1. Shared State and Services That Just Work
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
  Astro didn’t give me a clean way to share state between different parts of the
  site. I ended up juggling context providers and global stores, and it felt
  duct-taped together.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  Angular gave me dependency injection and services out of the box. I can keep
  business logic separate from components and share data anywhere without
  reinventing the wheel.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. Real Routing Power</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
  Astro handles static routing beautifully but falls short when you want dynamic
  routing with parameters, guards, or lazy loading.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  Angular’s router is in a different league. I can build routes with parameters,
  protect them with guards, and lazy-load modules to keep the app fast. It’s
  like going from local streets to a full highway system.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">3. TypeScript Everywhere, For Real</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
  Astro supports TypeScript, but it’s not enforced or deeply integrated in the
  same way Angular is. Angular lives and breathes TypeScript. Templates,
  services, routing — everything benefits from strong typing.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  It’s saved me from countless bugs during refactoring. I know exactly what’s
  expected where, which keeps my code safer and more maintainable.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">
  4. CLI and Tooling That Make Life Easier
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
  Astro’s simplicity is great, but it leaves you to wire up lots of tools
  yourself if your project grows.
</p>
<p class="mb-8">
  Angular’s CLI gives me commands for generating components, services, and
  modules, plus automated testing and production builds. It’s a huge timesaver
  and helps me keep my code organized.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How My Site Has Changed</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
  Since moving to Angular, my portfolio isn’t just a static site anymore. It’s a
  small app.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
  <li>I’ve added dynamic content rendering</li>
  <li>Blog posts load dynamically with routing parameters</li>
  <li>I’m prepared for future integrations, like APIs or authentication</li>
  <li>The codebase is structured and easier to maintain</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">
  Astro was perfect when I just wanted a lightweight static site. But my vision
  outgrew what it could comfortably handle.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
  Would I Recommend Angular for Everyone?
</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
  Not necessarily. If you’re building a simple blog or marketing page, Astro is
  brilliant. It’s fast, modern, and minimal.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  But if you’re thinking ahead to dynamic features, complex routing, or
  large-scale maintainability, Angular can save you a lot of headaches later on.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
  It’s easy to fall in love with new frameworks. Astro was amazing when my needs
  were small. But your tech choices should follow your goals, not the other way
  around.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  I’m glad I made the switch. My site is more powerful and future-proof, and I
  feel confident about building on it for years to come.
